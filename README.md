# Blackjack Game
## Description
This is a one player browser-based blackjack game pitting the player against the computer (dealer). In the instructions below, the word dealer is used but be aware that the dealer refers to the computer player.

## Instructions
To open the game, open the BlackJack.html file in a browser of your choice.

Click the 'New Game' button to start a new game. Two cards will automatically be dealt to the player and the dealer. The player will then have the option to 'Hit!' -- have an extra card dealt or 'Stay' -- stay at the current position. If the player goes above 21 points the player 'busts' and the game ends with the player having lost. If the player chooses to 'Stay', the turn phase will move to the dealer.

At this time the dealer will make their choice on 'Hitting' or 'Staying' and the current game will end. If there is a tie or the dealer's score is greater than the player's but less than or equal to 21, the win goes to the dealer. If the player's score is higher than the dealer's score but less than or equal to 21, then the win goes to the player.

The objective is obviously to have a higher score than the dealer but less than or equal to 21.
